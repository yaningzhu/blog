## Rails server getting SSL error from certain websites


### The Problem

Our Rails servers have problems hitting a number of websites. Using this particular one for example:

```
irb(main):001:0> HTTP.head('https://www.clinicalcorrelations.org')
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
```

OKay... that's certainly strange. Time for some investigation.

### The Investigation

I tried `curl` next:

```
# curl -L 'https://www.clinicalcorrelations.org' > /dev/null
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
```

If we use the `-vvv` with curl, it shows some more info:

```
* Connected to www.clinicalcorrelations.org (216.165.125.48) port 443 (#0)
* successfully set certificate verify locations:
*   CAfile: none
  CApath: /etc/ssl/certs
...
...
...
* SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

That tells me something is possibly wrong with our SSL certs.

#### Attempt fix #1

Maybe we can update our CA certificate bundle.

```
# sudo apt-cache policy ca-certificates
ca-certificates:
  Installed: 20170717~14.04.1
  Candidate: 20170717~14.04.1
```

Nope, seems pretty up-to-date to me.

#### Investigation continued

I hear `openssl` will possibly show us more info, so we do that:

```
# openssl s_client -connect www.clinicalcorrelations.org:443
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA
verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
verify return:0
...
...
    Verify return code: 19 (self signed certificate in certificate chain)
---
```

Okay, that gives us a google-able error.

...googling...

From what Google tells me, the s_client command in openssl assumes nothing. So you want to pass your CApath. Let's do that:

```
# openssl s_client -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect www.clinicalcorrelations.org:443
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = NY, L = New York, O = NYU Langone Medical Center, CN = *.med.nyu.edu
verify return:1
...
...
    Verify return code: 0 (ok)
---
```

Sweet! that works!

#### Attempt fix #2

We just have to pass the CApath into curl, right?

```
# curl --capath /etc/ssl/certs -L 'https://www.clinicalcorrelations.org' > /dev/null
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
...
```

Nope, same error.

That's when I realized, even previously, curl already assumed `CApath: /etc/ssl/certs`. So why are curl and openssl different? I have no fucking idea.

#### Even more investigation

So our original problem is coming from Rails. As long as we get it working in Rails, we can forget about this curl and openssl bullshit.

Google tells me I should set the environment variable `ENV['SSL_CERT_FILE']`. We should be able to set it to the default Ubuntu CA cert location.

#### Attempt fix #3

```
irb(main):002:0> ENV['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
=> "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
irb(main):003:0> HTTP.head('https://www.clinicalcorrelations.org')
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
```

Nope, doesn't work. But what about the specific cert that worked with openssl?

```
irb(main):004:0> ENV['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = "/etc/ssl/certs/DigiCert_High_Assurance_EV_Root_CA.pem"
=> "/etc/ssl/certs/DigiCert_High_Assurance_EV_Root_CA.pem"
irb(main):005:0> HTTP.head('https://www.clinicalcorrelations.org')
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
```

Nope. Same fucking error.

At this point I was getting bothered by other stuff. So not sure what to do from here.

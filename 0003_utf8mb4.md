**Intro**

Older versions of MySQL still defaults to `latin1` encoding. If you forgot to set the encoding after booting up a fresh server, all your schemas and tables will be in `latin1` encoding, which means you won't able to store certain special characters with accents, or emojis. That simply won't work for most people today.

At the same time, also beware of MySQL's `utf8` encoding. It's not real utf8. MySQL's `utf8` encoding is only three bytes, while some utf8 characters or emojis are four bytes.

Make sure you are using the `utf8mb4` encoding if you want to store the full range of utf8 characters.

**Setting Encoding**

You can set encoding at the server level to make sure all your future schemas will be the proper encoding. Or if you only need it on one schema, it's possibly to set it for that one schema only.


***Server Level***

On the server level, you'll want to include the following to your MySQL's bootup config (my.cnf):

```
[mysqld]
...
...
character-set-server=utf8mb4
collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

Here we specified the collation to be `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`. If you don't specify anything, it will default to `utf8mb4_general_ci`. There are minor differences between the two. Research before you pick one.


***Specific Schema or Table Level***

If you need to set the default for a schema only, it's easy to do


```
alter schema <schema_name> default character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Or just an individual table:


```
alter table <table_name> default character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

You can even do it on an individual column if you want.

**Convert**

The previous section shows how to set a default, which takes effect for future schema/table/column that you create. But it doesn't help with current schema that are on the wrong encoding.

The easiest way is to convert tables individually. This will work for almost everything:

```
alter table <table_name> convert to character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

From my personal experience, this will work for conversion between latin1 and utf8mb4, since one character set is a subset of another. When you get into other conversions though, it becomes unsafe to convert directly. You'll want to convert to binary first, then convert a second time to the character set you want.

Don't forget to set defaults after conversion is done.

***Tips***

- Because ALTER TABLE will take a while to run on larger tables, if you are doing this in production, make sure you are doing this during low traffic times, or use an online table migration tool.
